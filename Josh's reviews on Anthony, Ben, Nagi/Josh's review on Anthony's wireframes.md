## Heuristic Evaluation on Anthony’s Wireframes  
**Evaluator Name:** Josh

**Severity Rating Guide**  
0 = I don't agree that this is a usability problem at all  
1 = Cosmetic problem only: fix if time is available  
2 = Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority  
3 = Major usability problem: important to fix, given high priority  
4 = Usability catastrophe: fix this before product can be released

| 1  | Visibility of system status                 | Wireframes frequently use large elements that can potentially cause opportunities where more information could be display to be missed.<br><br>One example is with page 5 where the user would have to scroll a fair bit if there was a large set of instructions.<br><br>Another example is with page 3 where reducing the filter sizes could allow for additional filters or features e.g. back button.<br><br>Secondly a minor violation is the limited use of time estimates throughout the app. For example there are many instances where only distance is shown for walking distances.<br><br>Walking uphill 100m vs on flat ground 100m can take different times even though its the same distance which is quite crucial for a transportation app. | Having a drop down menu is an effective way to group things whilst minimizing space usage on pages.  One drop down could be used for the filters to provide more space.<br><br>It also provides users with more freedom of what information is shown to them on a given page.<br><br>Additionally for the second violation a simple fix could be to have a time estimate in minutes next to the distance shown.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 2        |
