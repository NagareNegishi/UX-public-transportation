## Heuristic Evaluation on Nagi’s Wireframes  
**Evaluator Name:** Josh

**Severity Rating Guide**  
0 = I don't agree that this is a usability problem at all  
1 = Cosmetic problem only: fix if time is available  
2 = Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority  
3 = Major usability problem: important to fix, given high priority  
4 = Usability catastrophe: fix this before product can be released  

| # | Heuristic | Violation | Recommendation | Severity |
|---|-----------|-----------|----------------|----------|
| 1 | Visibility of system status | While time estimates are given throughout the app, information on distances are not given, which can be quite crucial for walking scenarios | Showcase distances for journey segments in a similar fashion to how timings are currently displayed on pages. A small element for distance could even be placed adjacent to the existing time elements. | 1 |
| 2 | Match between system and the real world | No notable violations. | — | 0 |
| 3 | User control and freedom | No notable violations. | — | 0 |
| 4 | Consistency and standards | No notable violations. | — | 0 |
| 5 | Error prevention | Ideally a confirmation should exist that ensures that the user is fine with all individual setting changes. If the user denies the confirmation, setting changes will be reset to how they were before entering the page. | Provide a simple pop up with a yes/no confirmation for whether the user would like to "confirm all changes". | 2 |
| 6 | Recognition rather than recall | No notable violations. | — | 0 |
| 7 | Flexibility and efficiency of use | No notable violations. | — | 0 |
| 8 | Aesthetic and minimalist design | A few pages seem dense with information, potentially being over encumbering for users eg: 2:11. Some pages have too much variance in font sizes. See task 2:11, 2:15 as examples. | For 2:11 have a designated page for each destination and the properties the user picks eg: time. Font could be limited to 2–3 sizes. | 1 |
| 9 | Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors | No issues with how heuristic has been applied. | — | 0 |
|10 | Help and documentation | No issues with how heuristic has been applied. | — | 0 |
