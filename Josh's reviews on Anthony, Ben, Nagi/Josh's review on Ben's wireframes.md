| 1  | Visibility of system status                    | No clear way of viewing further details on individual transportation methods of the trip eg: letting the user view information about the first bus they catch.                                                                                          | Provide a dedicated service research page for buses/trains/transportation methods.                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 2        |
| 2  | Match between system and the real world        | The timing dropdown for when to notify the user on of their bus is nearby could be made more clear.                                                                                                                                                    | Rephrasing could potentially help. It could say "Notify when bus is x mins away" with the x being a drop down.                                                                                                                                                                              | 1        |
| 3  | User control and freedom                       | The current interface appears to limit the user’s ride selection by only letting them set when they want to arrive at their destination. Furthermore this feature only has 24 hour time implying that the user cannot select transportation for a different day. No parameters can be adjusted for when their journey should start or the ability to filter what should be prioritised eg: least walking distance, quickest overall time etc.. | Provide further filter options similar to how the current departure to drop-down is implemented. If ideally the overall spacing of the page needs to stay the same a pop-up journey setting menu could be access via a small button next to the to/from textboxes allowing for the overall footprint to remain close to the current size. | 3        |
| 4  | Consistency and standards                      | No notable violations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | —                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 0        |
| 5  | Error prevention                               | There is no clear way demonstrated for editing / removing saved plans.                                                                                                                                                                                 | Potentially covered in the saved plans wire fire button a simple trash can and pencil icons could be added as buttons next to each saved plan for editing and deleting. These could then bring up relevant pop-ups.                                                                            | 2        |
| 6  | Recognition rather than recall                 | No notable violations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | —                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 0        |
| 7  | Flexibility and efficiency of use              | While there is some nonlinearity to the user flow, more shortcuts could be provided. Could look into showcasing ways to sort groups to share with and sort order filters appear. Furthermore, options to set multiple destinations on a journey could speed up the process of having to create multiple journeys each time you want a specific stop point. Finally ways of viewing recent trips and autofill features for when the user is part-way through filling out a text box could be demonstrated. | —                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 2        |
| 8  | Aesthetic and minimalist design                | For frame 2: the top half has a lot of elements without clear groupings. currently this frame has too many loose elements                                                                                                                              | Reduce the distance between the Share with group toggle and the Group.. drop-down. Implementing further borders / divisions could improve layout readability.                                                                                                                               | 1        |

| 10 | Help and documentation                         | No explanation as to what Disability Mode does. No clear indicators given for additional documentation.                                                                                                                                               | Adding an info icon next to the toggle could provide helpful knowledge via a pop up on clicking it. Provide a dedicated page for all of the app's documentation. Alternatively multiple smaller help panels could be brought up next to their corresponding elements / sections of the UI via a three dots button or further use of info icons. | 2        |
