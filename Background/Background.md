# Background to the Project

## Project Overview

Our group application focuses on developing a comprehensive public transportation app that addresses the diverse needs of urban commuters. Building upon the foundation established in Assignments 1 and 2, our prototype aims to improve the public transportation experience for urban users by making it easier for people with varying schedules, purposes, and preferences to navigate, plan, and use public transport more effectively.


## Key Aspects of Transportation Experience Improvement

Our prototype addresses three critical aspects of the urban public transportation experience:

### 1. Intelligent Route Planning and Real-Time Information
**Primary Focus**: Streamlining the journey planning process with comprehensive route options and live updates.

Our prototype tackles the complexity of urban transportation by providing users with efficient route planning capabilities that include real-time alerts and schedule information across multiple transport modes. This addresses the common pain point of uncertainty and delays that urban commuters face daily. Users can quickly plan routes, check both current and upcoming alerts for different transportation categories (buses, trains, and ferries), and receive proactive notifications about service disruptions affecting their preferred transportation options. The system provides comprehensive visibility into the status of all public transport modes, enabling users to make informed decisions about their travel choices.

### 2. Accessibility and Inclusive Design
**Primary Focus**: Ensuring transportation information is accessible to users with diverse needs and abilities.

Recognizing that urban users have varying accessibility requirements, our prototype incorporates accessibility options that can be easily accessed and customized. This includes features designed for users with mobility considerations, visual impairments, and other accessibility needs.
Additionally, the prototype addresses language diversity by providing language selection options for users who prefer non-English interfaces, ensuring the app serves New Zealand's multicultural urban population effectively.
The accessibility framework also includes integrated help and support systems, providing users with contextual assistance and guidance when navigating transportation options. Users can access these settings both through route planning filters and dedicated settings screens, ensuring the app adapts to individual requirements and provides necessary support when needed.

### 3. Personalization and Information Management
**Primary Focus**: Creating a personalized experience that supports users' recurring travel patterns and information sharing needs.

Our prototype addresses the need for personalized transportation management by implementing a comprehensive favorites system. Users can save frequently used routes, export transportation information to their personal calendars, and share route details with others through a secure sharing interface that includes confirmation prompts to prevent accidental sharing. This aspect recognizes that urban commuters often have regular travel patterns while also needing flexibility for one-off journeys and coordination with family or colleagues. The design ensures users maintain control over their information while facilitating easy collaboration when needed.
