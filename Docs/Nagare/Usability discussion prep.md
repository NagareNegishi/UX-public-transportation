What were the most interesting things you found from user testing?
Some users rely on shape rather than color to identify application states, suggesting color alone may not be an effective visual indicator
Users had no difficulty reading small text, likely due to the age demographic of our test group
No users initiated route searches using the route button in the tab bar, indicating potential discoverability issues, or just search bar is really noticeable



What did you learn from conducting the user testing?
Running the test revealed that tasks need clear, focused objectives rather than open-ended instructions, which created confusion for both facilitators and users
Each task should target specific, concrete aspects of the interface to enable clear verification and identification of issues


What were the most significant results you found from user testing?
One user completely skipped the transport mode filter, either forgetting the requirement or not noticing the option, indicating a potential discoverability issue with essential filtering features
Users expected alerts to be route-specific when accessed from route information, but the system shows all alerts, reducing the relevance and usefulness of alert information
The search bar positioning creates thumb reach issues on mobile devices, potentially impacting core functionality for the primary use case
Users expected text size settings in general settings rather than accessibility, suggesting the information architecture doesn't match user mental models
