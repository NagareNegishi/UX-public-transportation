Tasks

Task 1 without instructions:
Go through the provided application and plan out a journey route. During planning you should aim to find any additional route details you can. Complete the task by checking for any alerts that could affect the route and return to the home page.

Task 2 without instructions:
Go through the provided application and find the accessibility settings page. Go through all accessibility options, and select what is best suited for your needs. If any of the default accessibility settings meet your needs, make it verbally clear to test organisers. Once completed go back to the home page.

Task 3 without instructions:
Go through the provided application and find where favourite routes are shown. Once favourites are found, attempt to share the route by getting a copyable route link. Finally end the last task by going back to the home page.

Task 4 (Task 1 without instructions + allowed to use the task pre-made hint):
Hint -  The key elements you want to look out for are the route information button and buttons highlighted in yellow and/or contain text “Alerts” for alerts.

**Which may lacks some details, as instructions. Those are suggestion with little more details.**

### Task 1: Journey Planning and Navigation

we want to check 3 things:
"Plan a route from Wellington Station to Victoria University"
"Find alerts for this route before starting navigation"
"Start navigation"

Then without Instructions:
"Plan a route from Wellington Station to Victoria University, check for any alerts, and start navigation."
"Think aloud as you work through this. If you get stuck or confused at any point, just tell us what you were expecting to happen."

### Task 2: Accessibility Settings

We want to test 3 menu areas:
- Transport Options
- Accessibility
- Language
(- Help & Support)

But combining them make it difficult to identify the issues, so we will split them into 3 tasks.
We're combining accessibility and transportation because they use the same interface pattern and test navigation between settings pages.

Then without Instructions:
- "Turn on an accessibility option that would help you and set your preferred transportation method, then return to the home page."
- "Adjust the text size to make it easier to read, then return to the home page."
- "Find and change the app language to a different option, then return to the home page."

All 3 with "Think aloud as you work through this. If you get stuck or confused at any point, just tell us what you were expecting to happen."

After that check if any accessibility or transport options they need are missing from the prototype.
