### Methodology - How many users and what you are testing

6 students from same class:
Prerequisites Courses you must pass before you can enrol in this course.
COMP 261 or SWEN 221; (both paper requires COMP 103)
which means all students are 3rd year students who studied computer science
Age group are likely to be 20-25 years old.

Some participants name suggest, they are part Asian, but it is not clear or even appropriate to make assumptions.

what you are testing?????????

### The script - What you say to the users

1. Introduction
   - Explain the purpose of the usability test. (and about the prototype)
   - Assure participants that their feedback is valuable and will help improve the prototype.
   - Inform them that the session will be recorded for analysis purposes??? or not recorded to ensure privacy.
2. Setup
   - Ask participants to "Think Aloud" during the test, describing their thoughts and actions as they interact with the prototype.
   - Encourage them to express any confusion, frustration, or satisfaction they experience.
   - Explain them for note taking, we appreciate if they do not haste the process, even if they are sure about how to navigate the prototype.
   - Ask participants to log in to the prototype.
   - Ensure they are comfortable with the interface and know how to navigate.
   - Ensure microphone and camera are working.

### Roles - Who is doing what

- Moderator: One team member will lead the session, guiding participants through the prototype and asking questions.?
- Observer: Another team member will take notes, observing user interactions and recording any issues or feedback.
- Participant: The user who will interact with the prototype, providing feedback and insights based on their experience.
- Analyst: After the session, one or more team members will analyze the recorded session and notes to identify usability issues and areas for improvement.


### Tasks - What are you testing

likely 3 tasks?

setting menu has 4 sections, so we can ask participants to navigate through each section and provide feedback on usability? can be done in 1 task? or divide into 4 tasks?

### Metrics - How you are measuring (e.g. SUS, NASA TLX)

Likely we will use SUS (System Usability Scale) to measure usability of the prototype.
As NASA TLX requires more participants, we will not use it.
Also the it will require more time to implement it, and our prototype is not at the stage to conduct workload assessment.


### Usability Goals - what is the level you are happy with on the above metrics

- SUS Score: Aim for a score of 70 or above, indicating good usability?
- Task Success Rate: Aim for a success rate of 80% or higher, meaning participants can complete tasks without significant issues?
- Time on Task: Aim for an average time of 2 minutes or less for each task, indicating efficiency?

### Problem Severity - How bad are the problems

?????
- Critical: Issues that prevent users from completing tasks or cause significant confusion. These should be addressed immediately.
- Major: Issues that hinder usability but do not completely block task completion. These should be prioritized for resolution.
- Minor: Issues that are annoying but do not significantly impact usability. These can be addressed in future iterations.
- Cosmetic: Issues that do not affect usability but may impact the overall user experience. These can be addressed last.
- Trivial: Issues that are very minor and do not impact usability. These can be ignored for now.



### Group decision - 6/5/2025

Make one Usability Test plan together as a group, detail was discussed on discord meeting on.
I will write the part, Methodology.

My part of Usability Test plan.

### Methodology
Six participants will be acting as test users in usability testing. Users will carry out testing with a prototype version of the system created on Figma. 

- Primary Approach - In-Person Testing: 

Testing will be conducted in a controlled environment where participants and moderators are co-located, specifically in ECS computer labs CO238 or CO242. 

- Alternative Approach - Remote Testing: 

If circumstances require, testing can be conducted remotely through Discord voice channel with screen sharing and Figma prototype access.

**Participants**

Participants in testing have been selected from SWEN303 class. Based on the prerequisites of the course, participants are likely 3rd year computer science or engineering major students, or someone studying programming at some level.

The age group is likely 20-30, representing a generation that has grown up with digital technology and is familiar with mobile applications and user interfaces. Additionally, all participants have studied transportation applications as part of this course curriculum, giving them prior exposure to common design patterns and user experience principles in this domain. 

Participants will be asked to complete 3-6 tasks that provide a comprehensive overview of the system's functionality. During task completion, participants are encouraged to think aloud to verbalize their thought process and decision-making. We will gather feedback from participants regarding the usability of the user interface and overall system function, with particular attention to any usability issues or problems they encounter. Following task completion, participants will complete a Prototype Usability Survey based on the System Usability Scale (SUS).

We are assuming that participants' average skill level with the system will be relatively high for first-time users because they are software engineering students with prior knowledge of transportation app design. Therefore, we believe they will be able to complete all tasks set out for them in testing, although this skewed participant pool and their pre-existing knowledge need to be taken into account when reviewing test results.

**Training**

Participants will be given a brief overview of the application (a public transportation app) and informed that this is a Figma prototype where elements can be interacted with using left-click, scrolling, and dragging. They will be told that while some UI elements may suggest other input methods, only these basic mouse interactions are functional in the prototype.

An overview of the usability test procedure will be provided, including a demonstration of the think-aloud process (using an unused wireframe as a mock example to show participants how to verbalize their thought process.) Participants will also be shown how to fill out the SUS form. Minimal emphasis will be placed on specific navigation patterns to preserve the authenticity of testing how intuitive the system layout is.

**Procedure**

- In-Person Testing:

Test participants will be asked to complete testing in a quiet corner of the lab with only one participant at a time. One facilitator and one note-taker will join them physically. If other team members want to observe, screen sharing will be set up so they can watch remotely without being physically present to avoid unnecessary pressure on the participant. The test will use lab computers or team member's laptops to open the Figma prototype after introduction and conduct the test.

- Remote Testing:

Test participants will be asked to complete testing in a quiet environment, preferably at their workstation or desk. The test facilitator and note-taker will join the participant in a Discord voice channel with screen sharing, with one participant at a time. The participant will be sent the system prototype through a Figma link which they can open in a browser without downloading additional software.

Common Procedure for Both Approaches:

Depending on time constraints, the introduction and training may be conducted for all 6 participants at once, followed by individual testing sessions. Otherwise, the process will be conducted individually for each participant.

Prior to opening the prototype, the test facilitator will introduce the system and explain the participant's role in the testing process. To encourage honest feedback, participants will be reassured that they are helping to evaluate the system's design and that their performance is not being assessed. The facilitator will also explain that any personal information, including names, will only be used for organizing the testing session and analyzing results. If any team members are observing the session, participants will be informed of their presence. The facilitator will then conduct the training as described in the Training section before accessing the prototype.

During individual testing sessions, the facilitator will present tasks one by one, ensuring participants understand each task before beginning. Participants will complete tasks using the think-aloud protocol as trained. If participants forget the task during completion, the facilitator may repeat the task or parts of it as needed. The facilitator will gather post-task feedback while the note-taker documents responses, behaviors, completion times, and any usability issues. After all tasks, participants will complete the SUS questionnaire independently.
