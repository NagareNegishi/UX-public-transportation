### Methodology - How many users and what you are testing

6 students from same class:
Prerequisites Courses you must pass before you can enrol in this course.
COMP 261 or SWEN 221; (both paper requires COMP 103)
which means all students are 3rd year students who studied computer science
Age group are likely to be 20-25 years old.

Some participants name suggest, they are part Asian, but it is not clear or even appropriate to make assumptions.

what you are testing?????????

### The script - What you say to the users

1. Introduction
   - Explain the purpose of the usability test. (and about the prototype)
   - Assure participants that their feedback is valuable and will help improve the prototype.
   - Inform them that the session will be recorded for analysis purposes??? or not recorded to ensure privacy.
2. Setup
   - Ask participants to "Think Aloud" during the test, describing their thoughts and actions as they interact with the prototype.
   - Encourage them to express any confusion, frustration, or satisfaction they experience.
   - Explain them for note taking, we appreciate if they do not haste the process, even if they are sure about how to navigate the prototype.
   - Ask participants to log in to the prototype.
   - Ensure they are comfortable with the interface and know how to navigate.
   - Ensure microphone and camera are working.

### Roles - Who is doing what

- Moderator: One team member will lead the session, guiding participants through the prototype and asking questions.?
- Observer: Another team member will take notes, observing user interactions and recording any issues or feedback.
- Participant: The user who will interact with the prototype, providing feedback and insights based on their experience.
- Analyst: After the session, one or more team members will analyze the recorded session and notes to identify usability issues and areas for improvement.


### Tasks - What are you testing

likely 3 tasks?

setting menu has 4 sections, so we can ask participants to navigate through each section and provide feedback on usability? can be done in 1 task? or divide into 4 tasks?

### Metrics - How you are measuring (e.g. SUS, NASA TLX)

Likely we will use SUS (System Usability Scale) to measure usability of the prototype.
As NASA TLX requires more participants, we will not use it.
Also the it will require more time to implement it, and our prototype is not at the stage to conduct workload assessment.


### Usability Goals - what is the level you are happy with on the above metrics

- SUS Score: Aim for a score of 70 or above, indicating good usability?
- Task Success Rate: Aim for a success rate of 80% or higher, meaning participants can complete tasks without significant issues?
- Time on Task: Aim for an average time of 2 minutes or less for each task, indicating efficiency?

### Problem Severity - How bad are the problems

?????
- Critical: Issues that prevent users from completing tasks or cause significant confusion. These should be addressed immediately.
- Major: Issues that hinder usability but do not completely block task completion. These should be prioritized for resolution.
- Minor: Issues that are annoying but do not significantly impact usability. These can be addressed in future iterations.
- Cosmetic: Issues that do not affect usability but may impact the overall user experience. These can be addressed last.
- Trivial: Issues that are very minor and do not impact usability. These can be ignored for now.
