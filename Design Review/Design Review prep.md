ideally 3- 5 Evaluation per

think to decide:
- Heuristic Evaluation? / Cognitive Walkthrough?
- -> maybe Heuristic Evaluation
We are all familiar with the transportation app

- template to use
    - the one in link or figma?
    - the link one may need to add score/ scale? issue per and total?
- Which Heuristics
    - Likely to use UI Rules of Thumb (Heuristics)
        1. Visibility of System Status
        2. Match between the System and the Real World
        3. User control (ctrl-z) and Freedom
        4. Consistency and Standards
        5. Error Prevention
        6. Recognition Rather than Recall
        7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use & efficient
        8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design
        9. Help User Recognise, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors
        10. Help and Documentation

## Evaluation Approach Decision
- [x] Conduct Heuristic Evaluation
- [ ] Conduct Cognitive Walkthrough
- [ ] Combine both approaches
- [ ] Other approach: ______________________
- [ ] Number of evaluation: ______________________


Selected Approach: Heuristic Evaluation
Number of Evaluations: 3 (at least 1)
Combination:
    Adam: Nagare, Philip, Josh
    Nagare: Ben, Anthony, Adam
    Ben: Philip, Josh, Anthony
    Philip: Adam, Nagare, Ben
    Anthony: Josh, Adam, Philip
    Josh: Anthony, Ben, Nagare

## Template Selection
- [x] Use template from provided link
- [ ] Create custom template in Figma
- [ ] Other template: ______________________

Selected Template: (https://www.figma.com/community/file/905622673082476274)

## Template Requirements
- [x] Include severity scale
- [x] Include issue count per heuristic
- [ ] Include total issues found
(- [ ] Include screenshots/references to problem areas)
(- [ ] Include recommendations for improvements)

We make our own table -> pdf?


## Evaluation Timeline
- [ ] Date for distributing evaluation templates: ______________________
- [ ] Deadline for individual evaluations: ______________________
- [ ] Date for consolidating findings: ______________________
- [ ] Date for presenting results: ______________________

## Notes
- We are all familiar with the transportation app
- Aim for 3-5 evaluations per heuristic
