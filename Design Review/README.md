our design evaluations were based on Nielsen's usability heuristics
each evaluation is a collection of each heuristic judged by
-violation
-recommendation
-severity
this would allow us to quantitatively measure each design's strengths
so that in the prototyping process we would know what design to use.

we chose to assign each member 3 other designs to review,
and then added them up into an average table so that we could compare designs
